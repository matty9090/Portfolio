        "For the <b>Games for the Internet</b> module we were tasked with creating a game using the <a href=\"https://phaser.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Phaser</a> game framework. The theme for the game must be time travel. My game, called Life, is based on the progressive life of a character. Each level is a different stage of life, where the goal is to reach the time machine at the end of each level."
