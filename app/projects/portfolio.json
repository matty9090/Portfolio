        "I decided to experiment with devops and new web technologies, therefore, I decided to rewrite my portfolio using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js</a>/<a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Express</a> and find a good devops workflow. Using <a href=\"https://travis-ci.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis CI</a> for continuous integration, when I push to master it deploys to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon AWS</a> and the new changes are live in minutes.",
        "Whilst this probably wasn't worth the time and effort to speed up the overall development of the portfolio for the amount of time I work on it, it was definitely a good learning process which can be reapplied for any future web applications."
