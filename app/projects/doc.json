        "Over summer a friend and I decided to play around with Unreal. We worked on a game where you can control a civilisation with procedurally generated worlds.",
        "Retrospectively, as this was our first time developing using Unreal, the code was not very maintainable and was very improvised. However, we implemented various features including custom navigation for use on a spherical world and a nice, smooth arcball rotation."
