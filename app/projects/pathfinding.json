        "The assignment for the 2nd year Games Dev 1 module was to implement the A* search algorithm and visualise it graphically.",
        "After already implementing A* in my personal project I could reuse the code and focus on getting a visualisation working where it shows the open and closed list. The most challenging, but fun part was making the bezier curves."
