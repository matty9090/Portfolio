        "My 3rd year project was creating procedurally generated planets. The features include: LOD (level of detail) Terrain, Water, Clouds, Biomes and an Atmosphere. The LOD terrain is based off CLOD (continuous level of detail) and uses six quadtrees to form a cube. This is then mapped to a sphere.",
        "I use 3D Simplex Noise for terrain generation and don't draw any panels beyond the horizon for performance. The terrain is also dynamically lit using shaders. The biomes are generated by using two noise maps, the first is for elevation, the second for moisture. For more details on the project, view the report.",
        "Also, check out the editor I made to play around with the parameters in realtime."
