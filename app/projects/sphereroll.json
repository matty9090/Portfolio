        "My game, <a href=\"https://matty9.itch.io/sphereroll\" target=\"_blank\">SphereRoll</a> was lucky enough to reach the final stage of the competition. You have to roll a sphere around a level with turrets to reach the goal. As the player, you can shoot at the turrents, but due to the concentration needed to roll around the level, I implemented auto aiming to help out. You can view all of the submissions <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/rising-star-game-dev-challenge-2018\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
