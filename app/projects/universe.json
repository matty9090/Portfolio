        "For my masters project, I'm creating a procedural universe where you can explore millions of worlds, from universe scale to planet scale. I've used techniques such as the realtime baking of a skybox to render distant galaxies, and a volumetric effect using lots of camera-facing billboards.",
        "The procedural planets are taken from my 3rd year project where I've modularised them so the planet can be randomised with various components. The components I have so far are: terrain, water, rings and an atmosphere. Every planet is different due to way they're seeded, theoretically there are <span class=\"inline-code\">2<sup>63</sup> - 1</span> (max 64 bit integer) possible unique planets."
